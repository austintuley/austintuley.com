I’m Austin Tuley, a systems administrator working in aerospace and defense manufacturing, with a focus on systems administration, network operations, and vulnerability management.

I focus on understanding systems end-to-end — how they’re built, how they fail, and how thoughtful design and discipline improve resilience over time.
